# Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** Flutter is a popular open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.





# Widgets Used

* Rows: The Row widget is used to arrange its children in a horizontal line.
* Columns: The Column widget is used to arrange its children in a vertical line.
* Container: The Container widget is used to provide a visual structure and decoration for the content.
* Icons: The Icons class provides a collection of pre-defined icons that can be used in the app.
* BoxDecoration: The BoxDecoration class is used to add a background, border, or other visual effects to the Container.
State Management





# State Management

In this app, we use the **'setState'** method, which is a feature of **'StatefulWidget'**. The state of a **'StatefulWidget'** can change over time, and **'setState'** allows us to update the state and trigger a rebuild of the user interface to reflect the latest changes.


# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the Flutter team and the open-source community for their contributions and support.

Feel free to customize this README to add any specific information about your app. Happy coding!
